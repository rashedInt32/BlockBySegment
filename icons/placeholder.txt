Icons needed: icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

You can generate these icons using the generate-icons.html file:
1. Open generate-icons.html in a web browser
2. The icons will download automatically
3. Save them in this icons/ directory

Or create simple placeholder icons temporarily by:
- Creating any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images
- Naming them icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
- Placing them in this directory

The extension will work without icons, but they're recommended for better UX.
